--  ✅ V55 (Updates #55–56): Online Deposit multi-entry/Bank+Depot
--           overhaul + SO Dashboard "Today's Total Sale" widget.
--           ONE table changed (`online_deposit` — new `id` PK + new
--           `deposit_method` column, additive/non-destructive), still
--           exactly 12 API files (both changes live inside the
--           existing `api/expenses.js` and `api/dashboard.js`):
--           #55 `online_deposit` converted from one-row-per-date
--              (upserted, so a 2nd entry the same day overwrote the
--              1st) to one-row-per-ENTRY: new `id UUID PRIMARY KEY`,
--              `date` no longer unique by itself, new required
--              `deposit_method TEXT CHECK IN ('bank','depot')` column.
--              `deposit-set` now INSERTs instead of upserting (so any
--              number of entries/day are kept, each tagged bank/depot);
--              `deposit-get`'s today/month figures are now a SUM over
--              that date range's rows, not a single row read, and both
--              now resolve "today" via `bdtToday()` (Asia/Dhaka) instead
--              of the server's raw UTC clock, fixing the early-morning-
--              BDT day-boundary mismatch that made a just-saved entry
--              seem to "not show up" in the today box; `deposit-history`
--              gained a `period=YYYY-MM` parameter (defaults to the
--              pay-cycle containing `date`) so the breakdown modal can
--              page to any past month with data, returns `method` per
--              row, and is reused as-is to feed the client-side monthly
--              PDF/JPG deposit slip (rendered with the same html2canvas
--              share-panel pattern as the existing challan slips — no
--              server-side storage).
--           #56 SO Dashboard: the "👥 আমার DSR" name-list tab is
--              removed (the underlying `assignedDsrs`/`dsrIds` data
--              this tab merely displayed is untouched and still powers
--              DSR-due and DSR-transaction features elsewhere). In its
--              place, a new "📦 আজকের মোট বিক্রয়" tab shows, per
--              product, RAW pieces sold today (`give` − `return`
--              units, from `transactions`, across this SO's assigned
--              DSRs only) — no `bonus` top-up mixed in — sorted
--              highest-sold first, product photo + name from the
--              existing `products` table. Pure application-logic
--              change in `api/dashboard.js` (`role='so'` block, new
--              `todayProductSales` response field) — no schema change
--              for this part.
--           ℹ️  Punch-time cutoff request (Manager by 8:00 AM, SO/DSR/
--              Driver by 8:30 AM) — VERIFIED ALREADY CORRECT in the
--              existing codebase since V44 Update #8 (see
--              `api/attendance.js`, action=`punch`, `onTimeEndMin`).
--              No change was needed or made for this item.
--  ✅ V52 (Updates #52–54): Point-of-Sale customer search + Daily
--           Deposit breakdown. PURE application-logic change — NO new
--           table, NO new/changed column, still exactly 12 API files:
--           #52 Point-of-Sale customer search — new read-only action
--              `GET /api/shops?action=pos-customer-search&q=` searches
--              both `shops` and the V49 `pos_customers` table by name/
--              phone, so a repeat point-sale customer (sale OR
--              damage/return) can be found and auto-filled instead of
--              retyped. `pos-customer-save` (V49) gained two optional
--              body fields, `selectedShopId`/`selectedCustomerId` — set
--              when the customer was picked from search, so that exact
--              record is reused/updated instead of re-matched by phone.
--           #53 Point-sale damage/return sub-flow now captures the same
--              full customer fields as the sale side (V49): keeper
--              name, phone, address — not just a bare name — and calls
--              `pos-customer-save` before the `point_damage_return`
--              transaction is written, tagging it with a real
--              `shop_id`/`customer_id` (both columns already existed
--              from V49) instead of only a free-text `note`.
--           #54 "এই মাসের মোট জমা" (this month's total online deposit)
--              is now tappable, opening a date-by-date breakdown of the
--              current pay-cycle's deposits. New read-only action
--              `GET /api/expenses?action=deposit-history&date=` — a
--              pure read over the existing `online_deposit` table using
--              the same V41-#7 pay-cycle boundary (26th → 25th) as the
--              existing `deposit-get` running-total action.
--  ✅ V49 (Updates #47–51): Owner/Manager Dashboard Cleanup + Point-of-
--           Sale batch. ONE new table (`pos_customers`) + one additive
--           column (`transactions.customer_id`) — still exactly 12 API
--           files:
--           #47 "Top 4 Products" widget replaced with a full ranked SKU
--              list — every product, #1 (best-selling) down to the
--              lowest, for both "today" and "this month". Pure
--              application-logic change in api/dashboard.js
--              (buildTopSellers → buildRankedSellers) — no schema
--              change, response fields renamed top4Today/top4Month →
--              rankedToday/rankedMonth.
--           #48 "Recent Transactions" widget removed entirely from the
--              Owner/Manager dashboard — the backing query in
--              api/dashboard.js and the `recent` response field are
--              both gone.
--           #49 DSR/SO due amount is now tappable — opens that
--              person's full due transaction history (source: give/
--              return/payment, date, product, shop when there is one).
--              New read-only action `GET /api/transactions?action=
--              due-history&srId=` — pure read over the existing
--              `transactions` + `sr_payments` tables, no schema change.
--              `transactions.shop_id` (already a column, previously
--              unused by any live code path) is now surfaced through
--              `mapTx` so this and future features can read it.
--           #50 Bengali numeral/digit font fix — 'Noto Sans' now loads
--              alongside 'Hind Siliguri' and is listed FIRST in every
--              font-family stack app-wide. Noto Sans has no Bengali
--              glyphs, so all Bengali text still renders in Hind
--              Siliguri exactly as before; only digits 0–9 (where Hind
--              Siliguri's '1' glyph looked visually off) now render
--              from Noto Sans. Front-end only, no API/schema change.
--           #51 Point-of-Sale now captures full customer details (shop/
--              customer name, phone, address, keeper name — the same
--              basic fields as normal shop registration) as a proper
--              stored record, instead of only a free-text name. A phone
--              number that matches an existing REGISTERED shop reuses
--              that shop's real id/history; otherwise the details are
--              saved to the new `pos_customers` table (deliberately
--              separate from `shops` so a walk-in customer never
--              pollutes the Shop Registry, road/map filters, or the
--              duplicate-shop-name check from Update #38). The sale
--              transaction is tagged with whichever id applies via the
--              new `transactions.customer_id` column (mirrors the
--              existing `shop_id` column, which was defined back in
--              Update #11 but never actually written to by any live
--              code path until now). New action `POST /api/shops?
--              action=pos-customer-save`, called by the front-end
--              Point-Sale wizard right before the sale itself is saved.
--  ✅ V48 (Updates #37, #38, #44, #45, #46): Shop Registration fixes +
--           Reports batch. PURE application-logic change — no new
--           table, no new/changed column, still exactly 12 API files:
--           #37 Owner can edit a registered shop's name/phone (GPS stays
--              locked — delete + re-register to move it); deleting a
--              shop removes its map marker too.
--           #38 Registering/renaming a shop to the exact same name
--              (trimmed, case-insensitive) as an existing shop is now
--              blocked — `api/shops.js`'s `_isDuplicateShopName` helper,
--              checked on both `action=register` and the new edit
--              action.
--           #44 Every generated report/sheet now stamps its actual
--              generation date+time, not just who generated it.
--           #45 Daily SO report gains one extra line: how many distinct
--              SKUs were sold that day.
--           #46 New monthly damage report — one row per damaged SKU
--              (case count, piece count, total quantity, buying price),
--              scoped to the Update #7 pay-cycle month, spreadsheet-
--              style layout for reconciling total damage losses.
--  ✅ V47 (Updates #39–43): Reports & PDFs batch — SO daily report visual
--           overhaul + period-report improvements. PURE application-logic
--           change — no new table, no new/changed column, on top of the
--           existing `daily_so_reports` (report_data/due_data are JSONB,
--           already flexible) and `due_calendar` tables:
--           #39 SO PDF report visual overhaul — kept the exact same
--              architecture (rendered client-side from raw JSON via
--              html2canvas, never stored as a file, to keep Supabase
--              storage flat). Sale/return/damage columns are now
--              colour-coded (green/orange/red) throughout the challan
--              table, the route header now also prints the Road (Update
--              #21/#22) that SO/DSR belongs to when set, and both pages
--              of the document now show the actual server-side
--              generation timestamp (row.generatedAt), not just who
--              generated it.
--           #40 Every loading/return/damage/sold figure on the SO
--              challan is now printed as "X কেস Y পিস" (Update #15's
--              rule) using each product's own case_size, instead of a
--              bare piece count — api/report.js's product-meta fetch
--              (`fetchProductMetaMap`, formerly unit-type-only) now also
--              carries case_size through into report_data so this can
--              render without re-querying products.
--           #41 The "দর" (unit price) column on the SO challan is now
--              "কেস দর" (case price) — a straight display-time multiple
--              (rate × case_size) of the exact same per-piece rate the
--              টাকা/amount total already used; the underlying money math
--              is unchanged, only what that one column shows.
--           #42 Date-range analytics report (api/report.js's plain
--              `?from=&to=` action) gains a clearly-labelled "সারাংশ
--              বোর্ড" (Summary Board) section pulling delivery/return/
--              damage figures and their money totals for that exact
--              period into one place.
--           #43 "Two due figures on every report": the SO daily report's
--              existing due-report (today's due + carried-over previous
--              due = grand total) already had this shape and is now just
--              more clearly labelled; the date-range analytics report
--              gains the same concept company-wide — periodDue (due
--              created inside the picked range) and cumulativeDue (all
--              outstanding due as of the range's end date) — computed by
--              a new `computePeriodDueTotals` helper, pure read over the
--              existing `due_calendar` table.
--  ✅ V45 (Updates #28, #29, #32, #33, #34, #35, #36): Order flow +
--           DSR van-stock batch. ONE additive schema change (an
--           allowed-value addition, not a new column) — still exactly
--           12 API files, no new table:
--           #28 Simplified DSR Van-Load Completion — the old per-item
--              tick-then-finish flow is replaced with a single "সম্পন্ন"
--              button. orders.load_status gains a new value,
--              'load_complete', sitting between 'approved' (not yet
--              loaded) and 'loaded' (stock actually deducted): DSR
--              taps সম্পন্ন → load_status='load_complete' (no
--              transaction written yet) → Manager/Owner reviews the
--              color-coded item list and taps নিশ্চিত করুন
--              (api/sr-payments.js action=van_load_confirm) → THAT is
--              the point the real `give` transactions are written and
--              stock leaves the warehouse — same underlying write the
--              old van_load_finish did, just now gated behind an
--              explicit Manager/Owner approval instead of the DSR's own
--              tap, matching every other stock-affecting flow in the
--              app. Old van_load_tick/van_load_finish actions are kept
--              as harmless no-op-if-unused aliases for compatibility.
--           #29 Auto-generated, timestamped, downloadable/printable
--              order memo — pure front-end (reuses the existing
--              html2canvas-based _showSlipSharePanel), no schema change.
--           #32/#33 Fixed the "Empty Van" bug: the DSR's sell-to-shop
--              screen used to check main-WAREHOUSE stock (always > 0
--              for nearly everything) instead of what that DSR actually
--              had loaded that day. New read-only endpoint
--              api/sr-payments.js action=van-stock computes true,
--              day-scoped (no carry-over — never reads any date but the
--              one asked for) per-product van inventory: given −
--              returned − sold-to-shops − damage the Owner has already
--              reconciled (dmg_claims.status='cleared'); still-pending
--              damage stays counted as "in hand" per #33 until the
--              Owner clears it. No new table/column — pure read over
--              existing transactions + dmg_claims rows.
--           #34 Case+piece display (not raw pieces) + a visual refresh
--              on the DSR sell screen — pure front-end.
--           #35 Shop-visit due list now shows the full reason/status/
--              creation-time detail (same richer treatment Update #12
--              already gave the Owner's due calendar), not just a bare
--              date — pure front-end, reuses fields mapDue() already
--              returns (note, createdAt, status).
--           #36 Verified: no handshake/pairing UI remains anywhere on
--              the DSR dashboard (removed already back in Update #20) —
--              no further change needed.
--  ✅ V44 (Updates #18, #19, #30, #31): Auth + SO dashboard batch.
--           #18 First-login forced password setup for Owner — new
--              `user_passwords.must_change_pw` column (BOOLEAN, defaults
--              false; the seeded Owner row is inserted with it TRUE).
--              On login, api/auth.js POST now also returns this flag;
--              the front-end shows a non-dismissible "set your own
--              password" screen until the Owner submits a new PIN via
--              the existing PUT action=change, which clears the flag.
--           #19 Self-service "change my own PIN" is now reachable by
--              every role (Manager/SO/DSR/Driver), not just Owner — the
--              existing 🔐 পাসওয়ার্ড menu item (and its existing
--              action=change endpoint, unchanged) is now shown for all
--              roles; only the Owner still additionally sees the
--              "manage everyone's PIN" admin section beneath it. No
--              schema change needed for this one beyond #18's column.
--           #30 Handshake-protocol UI removal on the SO dashboard was
--              already completed back in V36 (Update #20 — auto-pairing
--              by registration order) — verified still fully removed,
--              no further change needed here.
--           #31 New "আজকের বিক্রয়" (today's sale) summary cards on the
--              SO dashboard — sale, damage, and returns figures for
--              today. Pure read: reuses existing `transactions` rows
--              already fetched by api/dashboard.js's SO section (adds
--              a `damage`/`returns`/`saleGross` breakdown to the
--              existing `today` object), no schema change.
--  ✅ V43 (Updates #1–6): Sales Targets batch. NO NEW TABLES, NO
--           COLUMN CHANGES — this batch is pure application-logic on
--           top of the existing `targets`/`product_targets` tables
--           from V24/V32:
--           #1 Per-product CASE targets: product_targets.target_qty is
--              now read/achieved as whole CASES (converted from raw
--              transaction pieces via each product's own case_size —
--              see api/attendance.js _achievedCasesByProduct), and the
--              list is ordered by products.sort_order to match the
--              Product Catalog instead of alphabetically.
--           #2/#3 Color-coded product blocks / per-SO themes — front-end
--              only (public/index.html TARGET_PALETTE), no schema/API
--              data shape change.
--           #4 BUG FIX: an individual SO's achieved-% used to filter
--              transactions by sr_id = the SO's own id, but real sales
--              are recorded under the DELIVERING DSR's id — so it was
--              effectively always ~0. Fixed to sum the SO + every DSR
--              auto-paired to them (srs.so_id), same "SO + assigned
--              DSRs" id-list pattern api/dashboard.js already used.
--           #5 Owner PIN now required (and re-verified server-side
--              against user_passwords) on every target save — target-set,
--              target-split-even, product-target-set.
--           #6 New read-only action=daily-target-split ("RADT" widget):
--              splits the remaining total case target across the
--              working days left in the pay cycle (Update #7), excluding
--              Friday — shown on every role's dashboard.
--  ✅ V41 (Updates #21–27): "Roads" / Routes — new feature. Owner
--           creates roads freely by name (`roads` table, #21); assigns
--           one SO per road and the SO's auto-paired DSR (Update #20)
--           inherits the same road automatically (#22 — srs.road_id/
--           road_name + roads.dsr_id/dsr_name, set by api/srs.js
--           action=road-assign-so); shop registration now picks a road
--           instead of a DSR, auto-deriving assigned_dsr_id/name from
--           that road (#23 — shops.road_id/road_name); shops can be
--           filtered by road (#24 — shops.js action=list/search now
--           accepts roadId); Owner schedules "SO visits road X on date
--           D, paired DSR delivers D+1" (#25 — `road_visit_plans`,
--           surfaced on both dashboards by api/dashboard.js); the map
--           shows same-day visit ticks per shop, colour-coded SO vs.
--           DSR, needing no cleanup job since every read is scoped to
--           today's date (#26 — `shop_visits`); and the map shows the
--           viewer's own live GPS position alongside DSR dots (#27 —
--           front-end only, public/index.html, no schema change).
--           No existing table's data or existing route's behaviour
--           changed — this is purely additive (2 new columns each on
--           `srs`/`shops`, 3 new tables).
--  ✅ V36 (Update #20): Removed the manual SO↔DSR "handshake" pairing
--           entirely (srs.so_link_status column + pair_request/
--           pair_accept/pair_reject actions are gone). Pairing is now
--           fully automatic by registration order: the 1st SO ever
--           registered (display_no=1) auto-pairs with the 1st DSR ever
--           registered (display_no=1), 2nd with 2nd, and so on — no
--           manual "connect" step anywhere in the app. so_id/so_name on
--           `srs` stay as the single permanent pairing link, now set by
--           the server at creation time instead of by hand. See
--           api/srs.js for the matching logic.
--  ✅ V35: (1) DSR পেমেন্ট পেজ — আজকের কমিশন/ছাড়/ড্যামেজের সারাংশ যোগ
--           হলো, যাতে পেমেন্ট হিসাব সঠিকভাবে সম্পন্ন করা যায়। এর জন্য
--           transactions টেবিলে দুটি নতুন কলাম: commission_amt,
--           discount_amt (দোকানে বিক্রয়ের সময় প্রতি-আইটেম কমিশন/ছাড়
--           এখন স্থায়ীভাবে সংরক্ষিত হয় — আগে শুধু বিলের মোট হিসেবে
--           দেখানো হতো, ডাটাবেসে জমা থাকত না)।
--           (2) ড্যামেজ লজিক সংশোধন — ড্যামেজ রেজিস্টার করলে এখন আর
--           স্টক কমবে না (পণ্যটি শুধু রিপোর্ট/দাবির জন্য চিহ্নিত হয়,
--           গুদামের স্টক অপরিবর্তিত থাকে)। ড্যামেজ রিপোর্টে এখনো ক্রয়
--           মূল্য (purchase_price/total_cost) ব্যবহার হয় — কোম্পানির
--           কাছে সরবরাহকারীর থেকে দাবির জন্য। DSR পেমেন্ট পেজে ঐ একই
--           ড্যামেজ এন্ট্রির বিক্রয় মূল্য (selling_price/total_revenue)
--           ব্যবহার হয় — DSR এর আজকের হিসাব থেকে বাদ দেওয়ার জন্য। এই
--           দুটি হিসাব ইচ্ছাকৃতভাবে আলাদা রাখা হয়েছে। NO NEW TABLE —
--           শুধু transactions এ ২টি কলাম যোগ; বাকি সব স্কিমা অপরিবর্তিত।
--  ✅ V34: Shop Delivery panel cleanup + GPS auto-detection + per-case
--           commission/discount (this update). Removed the "নতুন শপ
--           নিবন্ধন করতে চান?" shortcut link and the always-on full
--           "shop name + due/clean status" list from the DSR's শপ
--           ডেলিভারি panel (shop registration already lives on its own
--           dedicated tab). In their place: the panel now auto-detects
--           nearby registered shops from the DSR's live GPS position
--           (within 300m) — exactly one nearby shop auto-selects itself
--           with a one-tap "sell now" card, multiple nearby shops show
--           only those as a pick-list, and the manual search box still
--           works as a fallback. আজকের বাকি আদায় (Due Collection) section
--           is untouched, still at the very bottom of the same panel.
--           Also: the per-product Commission field in the delivery sale
--           screen is now "commission PER CASE" (total = rate × cases
--           sold, auto-calculated) instead of a manually-typed total, and
--           a new matching "ছাড় (Discount) per case" field was added
--           right below it with the same per-case × cases-sold logic.
--           NO SCHEMA CHANGE — this entire update is front-end logic
--           (public/index.html) only; every column it touches
--           (shops.lat/lng, due_calendar.*) already existed.
--  ✅ V33: Product Category + manual re-ordering (products.category,
--           products.sort_order — see products.js action=reorder /
--           action=categories), DSR dashboard gets its own dedicated
--           "শপ নিবন্ধন" tab (separated from the shop-visit/sell flow to
--           stop accidental taps) and a dedicated live "ম্যাপ" tab (every
--           registered shop + the DSR's own live GPS position + a
--           one-tap "নেভিগেট" that opens Google Maps turn-by-turn
--           directions). DSR sell screen reorganised (search + category
--           filter + clearer per-product quantity rows). No schema
--           change beyond the two new products columns above — shops.lat/
--           lng already existed.
--
--  ✅ FRESH INSTALL — নতুন Supabase project এ পুরোটা paste করুন
--  ✅ পুরানো data নেই, পুরানো table নেই — সম্পূর্ণ নতুন
--  ✅ শেষে Owner এর PIN সেট আছে: 12345
--  ✅ V9:  DSR-SO assignment (so_id), RLS data isolation
--  ✅ V14: Global Group Chat (group_chat_messages)
--  ✅ V17: Notice Panel (notices)
--  ✅ V18: Important Contacts (important_contacts)
--  ✅ V20: UI — Dark/Light theme toggle, Numbers tab (manager/SO/DSR),
--           Group Chat loading fix (timeout + retry)
--  ✅ V21: AXIION Blueprint §14+§15 — Live Location tracking, Office
--           geofence, Punch Attendance, Rewards/Penalties.
--           (bonus.js + damage.js merged into api/claims.js at the API
--           layer only — no schema change to the `bonus` / `dmg_claims`
--           tables themselves, they are untouched below.)
--  ✅ V22: Full Salary system — attendance now supports TWO punches/day
--           (in=morning, out=evening checkout 18:00→08:30 next day); a
--           day only pays if both exist (or Owner overrides it). Owner
--           sets a base monthly salary + optional configurable bonus
--           scheme per person per month (salary_settings), pays out per
--           month independently (salary_ledger), and can approve a
--           forgotten-punch day (salary_day_override). Replaces the
--           simpler V21 reward_ledger concept entirely.
--  ✅ V23: AXIION Blueprint §2+§3+§4 — 12-file rulebook finalised
--           (load-all.js folded into dashboard.js?action=load-all,
--           shops.js added as the 12th file), 4-decimal money precision
--           everywhere + products.case_price (§7 schema only — the
--           reverse price-entry UI lands separately), stable DSR/SO
--           display_no pairing (§10 — originally a manual handshake,
--           replaced by fully automatic same-number pairing in V36 /
--           Update #20), the full Shop Registry + due linkage (§11/§12),
--           and the SO Order → Approval → Van-Load workflow tables
--           (§13). Personal
--           Calculator (§21) and SO Daily Quota (§17) tables are also
--           included since their routes were added to expenses.js.
--  ✅ V24: AXIION Blueprint §7+§8+§9 — reverse price entry is now fully
--           live end-to-end (products.case_purchase_price column added;
--           owner types case/jar/poly buy+sell price, per-piece price is
--           derived server-side to 4-decimal precision); transactions
--           list now sorts newest-first everywhere; Owner Approval screen
--           gained a full item-level detail view + PIN-gated inline edit.
--           Also: side-menu items are now boxed/tappable, and Dark Mode +
--           Logout moved from the top bar into the side menu (Logout in
--           red) — front-end only, no schema impact from that part.
--  ✅ V25: AXIION Blueprint §17 — SO Dashboard full rebuild completed:
--           dashboard.js?role=so now accepts an optional from/to date
--           range and returns a regular-sale-vs-point-sale revenue/unit
--           split for today, this month, and any custom range. Owner can
--           now set each SO's daily "pay to company today" quota directly
--           from the DSR/SO staff list (🎯 button on SO rows), and the SO
--           sees their progress against it live on their own dashboard.
--           No schema change was required — so_daily_quota already
--           existed from V23. Also: 5 side-menu labels that were still in
--           English (Password Manager / Owner Approval / Group Chat /
--           Important Notice / Important Number) are now shown in Bengali
--           to match the rest of the menu — front-end only, DSR/SO stays
--           in English as instructed.
--  ✅ V25b: Order → Approval flow — the DSR is now auto-carried onto an
--           order from the SO's §10/§17 connect/handshake pairing at the
--           moment the SO places it (orders.assigned_dsr_id is pre-filled
--           from whichever DSR that SO is currently "accepted"-connected
--           with). Manager/Owner now just tap Approve — no more picking a
--           DSR from a dropdown every time. A manual "change" override
--           stays available for the rare case where the SO hadn't
--           connected with a DSR yet, or a different DSR is genuinely
--           needed. No schema change — reuses the existing
--           orders.assigned_dsr_id column, just populated earlier.
--  ✅ V26: AXIION Blueprint §18 — DSR Dashboard full rebuild: added a
--           Shop Visit workflow (search/detail/record-sale against the
--           existing shops.js §11 endpoints) and a Clear Plate tab
--           (today's outstanding shop dues) directly inside the DSR
--           dashboard, plus read-only access to the company Due
--           Calendar filtered to the DSR's own entries. Also: "দেওয়া"
--           (give) from Owner/Manager to a DSR now creates an
--           already-approved Load Task instead of writing stock
--           immediately — the DSR must tick every item and press
--           "Finish Loading" on the van-load checklist first, exactly
--           like an approved SO order (give to an SO is unchanged,
--           since an SO has no van to load). SO dashboard's 9-option
--           top bar and the DSR dashboard's own tab bar are now boxed
--           tappable tiles instead of a wrapping row of text buttons —
--           front-end only. shops.js list/search now also returns each
--           shop's outstanding totalDue. No new tables were needed —
--           this release reuses orders, shops, and due_calendar as-is.
--  ✅ V27: AXIION Blueprint §11 — full Shop Registry front-end (Owner/
--           Manager registration form with on-the-spot GPS capture +
--           printable QR, a shared "Shops & Map" page for Owner/Manager/
--           SO with search + a live map of every registered shop), DSR
--           on-site quick-registration + GPS auto-detect of the nearest
--           shop while visiting a route, and a free BarcodeDetector-based
--           QR scanner (no schema change — shops.lat/lng already
--           existed). Also: SO no longer has a punch/attendance button —
--           SO's own live location is still shared with Owner, and SO
--           can now see their assigned DSRs on a live map instead.
--           Morning on-time punch window widened from a single 08:30
--           cutoff to a 07:00–10:00 range (evening checkout window
--           unchanged); punch buttons now read "Present IN" / "Present
--           OUT". Important Contacts is now Owner-edit /
--           everyone-else-view-only (server + UI enforced). No table
--           changes in this release — every fix above was reachable
--           with columns that already existed.
--  ✅ V28: AXIION Blueprint §12 — Daily Due Collection / "Clear Plate"
--           finished as its own dedicated module (it had only existed as
--           a by-product of the §18 DSR dashboard rebuild until now):
--           the DSR's Clear Plate now shows a live total (shop count +
--           outstanding amount) at a glance, a one-tap "সম্পূর্ণ" button
--           to fill the exact remaining amount, and a tap-to-call phone
--           number per shop. A fully-paid shop visit now also writes an
--           already-cleared due_calendar row (instead of nothing) so
--           every visit — paid in full or not — leaves a real entry in
--           the shop's due history for a complete audit trail. Owner/
--           Manager also gain a company-wide Clear Plate overview card
--           on the Shops & Map page — today's outstanding collections
--           across every DSR, grouped and drillable. No schema change —
--           entirely additive logic on top of the existing due_calendar
--           table (shop_id/client_type already existed from V23).
--  ✅ V29: "শপ ডেলিভারি" merge — the DSR's separate "শপ ভিজিট" and
--           "ক্লিয়ার প্লেট" tabs are now ONE tab: search/GPS-nearest +
--           an inline shop map, shop due status with in-place "register/
--           collect due" before continuing, a delivery (sale) screen with
--           a select-all toggle + optional per-product commission, a
--           clear itemised bill (subtotal/discount/commission/net) with a
--           one-tap "সম্পূর্ণ" full-payment fill, and a printable/
--           downloadable slip after every sale. The day's outstanding
--           shop dues now live at the bottom of the same page instead of
--           a separate tab, and — per the DSR's own request — that list
--           is now a ROLLING 12-HOUR WINDOW from each due's creation time
--           (not the calendar day), so it quietly drops off on its own
--           after 12h and never causes day-boundary confusion on a long
--           route; the underlying due_calendar row is never deleted, only
--           this view's filter changed. NO SCHEMA CHANGE — every column
--           this touches (due_calendar.created_at/status, shops.*) already
--           existed; this is entirely additive front-end + query logic in
--           api/shops.js and public/index.html.
--  ✅ V30: AXIION Blueprint — Report Dashboard: Daily SO Delivery Report +
--           Due Report. New table `daily_so_reports` stores a full daily
--           snapshot per SO (product-wise loading/return/sale challan
--           across every DSR route under that SO, plus a companion
--           shop-wise due report — today's due, carried-over previous
--           due, and a per-shop breakdown). Reports auto-generate every
--           day at 02:00 Asia/Dhaka via a Vercel Cron hitting
--           api/report.js?action=cron-generate (needs env var
--           CRON_SECRET — see README), or the Owner can generate on
--           demand from the রিপোর্ট tab (Owner PIN required every time,
--           re-verified server-side). Only the most recent 60 dates are
--           kept per SO — older snapshots are pruned automatically on
--           every new generation. No changes to any existing table.
--  ✅ V31: "অনলাইন জমার পরিমাণ" simplified — replaced the old per-SO
--           daily quota (owner had to set a separate target for every
--           SO) with a single shared daily amount. Owner enters ONE
--           number each day ("আজকে অনলাইন জমা কত টাকা জমা হয়েছে") and
--           it shows identically on every SO's dashboard as two
--           numbers: আজকের জমা (today's amount) and এই মাসের মোট জমা
--           (sum of every day entered so far this month). New table
--           `online_deposit` (date PK, amount, set_by, set_at)
--           replaces `so_daily_quota` entirely.
--  ✅ V32: Sales Target page — added a SECOND target type below the
--           existing ৳ money target: owner can now also set a
--           quantity target per product (e.g. 500 কেস of a product
--           this month), company-wide. New table `product_targets`
--           (period, product_id, target_qty). Read-only progress bar
--           for everyone else, same live-computed achieved pattern.

--  V40: Incremental stock balance (products.current_stock)
--
--  PROBLEM this fixes: every dashboard load (owner/manager, SO, DSR,
--  and the app-boot load-all) used to re-fetch EVERY transaction row
--  ever created, just to sum up current stock per product. That's
--  correct but expensive — the amount of data pulled from Supabase
--  grows every single year as the transactions table grows, so the
--  same "load the dashboard" action slowly costs more and more
--  Supabase egress bandwidth over time, with no ceiling.
--
--  FIX: products.current_stock is now the single source of truth for
--  current stock, updated automatically at the database level by this
--  trigger every time a stock-affecting transaction row is inserted.
--  The API layer (api/dashboard.js) now simply reads this column off
--  the products row it already fetches — no more full-history refetch
--  for stock, on any dashboard, ever. This is a DATABASE trigger (not
--  app code) so it applies no matter which API route inserts a
--  transaction, now or in the future — nothing to remember to call.
--
--  Only 'buy' / 'give' / 'return' / 'point_sale' / 'point_damage_return'
--  affect stock — exactly matching the existing calcStock() logic in
--  api/_lib/db.js. 'damage' and 'dsr_sale' deliberately do NOT touch
--  stock (see the comments already in that function) and this trigger
--  preserves that same rule.

-- ── #26: Map — Daily Visit Tracking with Auto-Reset ──────────────────
-- One row per (shop, visitor, day). The DSR side is written
-- automatically by api/shops.js action=visit-sale (every real shop
-- sale IS a visit); the SO side is written by api/shops.js
-- action=visit-log, called from the SO's road view when they tick off
-- a shop they've physically visited that day (no sale attached, since
-- SOs don't carry stock). "Auto-reset at start of new day" needs no
-- cleanup job at all — every read is filtered to visit_date = today
-- (Asia/Dhaka), so yesterday's ticks simply stop matching on their own
-- the moment the calendar date rolls over; old rows are harmless
-- history and can be pruned occasionally if the table ever gets large.
