# AXIION DMS — Setup

## 1. Supabase — database
Create a project, open the SQL editor, and run `schema.sql` once. It is the complete schema for a fresh deployment: all tables, indexes, functions, triggers, security policies, seed data and the photo bucket.

## 2. Supabase — Storage (product/staff photos)
**Update (Glass Frosted Animation Beta 1):** `schema.sql` now creates the public `thumbs` bucket automatically. The manual steps below are only needed if that statement fails on your project.

The app uploads product and staff profile photos to Supabase Storage, not
the database. Create the bucket manually — `schema.sql` can't do this part:

1. Supabase dashboard → **Storage** → **New bucket**
2. Name it exactly `thumbs` (the code has this name hardcoded)
3. Toggle **Public bucket** ON — photos are served as plain public URLs,
   no signed-URL logic exists in this codebase
4. Nothing else to configure — no folders or policies needed beyond
   "Public"

## 3. Vercel — environment variables
The build succeeding does not mean the app can reach the database — the API
needs two environment variables set in Vercel (Project → Settings →
Environment Variables), not a "password":

| Name                   | Where to find it in Supabase                          |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `SUPABASE_URL`         | Project Settings → API → Project URL                    |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` | Project Settings → API → Project API keys → `service_role` |

Add both, then redeploy (env var changes don't apply to a build already in
progress).

## 4. GitHub / Vercel deploy
Push this folder to your repo and let Vercel auto-deploy, or drag-and-drop
the folder directly on Vercel. No other config changes are needed.

## 5. Serverless function limit (Vercel Hobby plan)
Hobby caps a deployment at 12 Serverless Functions. This project has
exactly 12 route files under `api/` (helper files under `api/_lib/` don't
count — Vercel excludes underscore-prefixed folders). If you add a new
`api/*.js` route later, merge it into an existing file (dispatch on
`?action=`) instead of adding a 13th file, or upgrade to a Pro/team plan.

## 6. First login
The schema seeds one login:

- Username: `owner`
- Password: `12345`

You'll be forced to set a new password on first login.

## 7. What's new in 4.7.0
`schema.sql` already includes everything (new `return_company` transaction type, order
columns, and the 35 default products). Nothing else to run.

- SO order / manager or owner "give" -> straight to the DSR's load list. The DSR presses
  "সম্পন্ন" after loading and stock is deducted at that moment. No approval steps.
- Orders tab and Approvals page show every order read-only (who, what, ordered vs loaded, times).
- Transactions -> "কোম্পানিতে ফেরত": removes stock only (blocked if it exceeds current stock).
- Still 12 API files.

## 8. What's new in 4.8.0
It adds 3 tables (`due_collections`, `damage_collections`, `dsr_settlements`) and allows manager
settlements in the approval queue. **Fresh installs:** `schema.sql` already contains everything.
Still 12 API files (new logic lives inside `sr-payments.js`, `shops.js`, `due-calendar.js`, `_lib/db.js`).

- **Van-stock cap.** A DSR can never sell more than is on his van. The quantity boxes clamp to the
  remaining van stock and the server (`shops.js` visit-sale) rejects any over-sale.
- **হিসাব/পেমেন্ট (owner/manager) — end-of-day settlement.** Pick DSR + date: cash, unsold return, damage,
  commission and discount are calculated automatically. One press applies it; pressing again cannot
  double-count (unique token + only "not yet settled" amounts are ever shown). Cash short of the expected
  amount simply stays in the DSR's due; collect it later with "শুধু নগদ জমা". Manager settlements go to
  the Owner's approval queue.
- **Unsold van stock** is returned to the warehouse automatically as a normal "ফেরত" transaction.
- **DSR menu: 📥 বাকি আদায়** — every shop with due (details, phone, road), collect any amount.
  Collected cash is added to that day's settlement automatically.
- **DSR menu: ⚠️ ড্যামেজ কালেকশন** — take damaged goods back from a shop and either pay the shop money
  or swap for a product from the van. Money paid out is deducted from the DSR's expected cash; both
  options count as damage in the settlement and open a pending claim in the Damage Report.
- **Owner/Manager tab 📥 আদায়** — see what each DSR collected (dues + damage) with shop details.
- **Road on shop registration** — the DSR's own registration form now has the Road field too, and the
  server refuses a shop without a road.

## 9. What's new in 4.8.1 — menu layout only (no SQL, no API change)
- New main-menu item **🧮 দিনশেষ হিসাব** (Owner + Manager, right under the Home tab). It holds
  **হিসাব/পেমেন্ট** (end-of-day settlement) and **বাকি পেমেন্ট** (due & damage collected by DSRs) as icon tiles.
- The **DSR/SO** page now has only icon tiles: 👥 তালিকা, ➕ যোগ করুন, 🛣️ রোড (add/delete/assign road stay here).

## 8. What's new in 4.9.0 — DU fix, 1000-row fix, speed
**Run the full `schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor.** The new v4.9 function and indexes are at the very bottom of it (they use `CREATE OR REPLACE` / `IF NOT EXISTS`). The app still works without them, just slower.

- One shared due calculation (`getDueTotals`) for Owner / Manager / SO / DSR — same DU everywhere. Uses a Postgres SUM (`dsr_due_totals`) instead of downloading all history.
- `fetchAll` now orders by `id` as a tiebreaker and loads pages in parallel (fixes rows skipped/repeated at page boundaries → the "sometimes wrong" DU).
- Shop list, duplicate-name check, due calendar, payment lists, reports: no more silent 1000-row cut-off.
- "Today" on SO/DSR dashboards now follows Asia/Dhaka time (was UTC).
- Owner bonus card loads only the give-history it needs; shop list paints 200 rows at a time; identical simultaneous GETs are merged; app shell revalidates instead of full re-download.
- Still 12 API files.

## 9. What's new in 4.9.1 — no database change needed
- **Owner/Manager → দিনশেষ হিসাব → 📥 বাকি পেমেন্ট:** every due collection now shows the **time** (Bangladesh time), shop, amount and a **📞 কল** button, grouped by DSR with a shop count and total ("N টি দোকান থেকে M বার আদায়").
- **Owner/Manager dashboard → 🏅 সেরা ৫০ দোকান:** top 50 shops by buying and payment behaviour (period + sort selectable), each with a one-tap call button. Loads only when the card is opened. Backed by `api/shops.js?action=top-shops`.
- Still 12 API files; `schema.sql` unchanged from 4.9.0.

## 6. Box-based sales targets
Sales targets are BOX-based (1 box = 1 full case of any SKU) alongside the money target. The `targets` table in `schema.sql` already includes the `target_boxes` column — running `schema.sql` once (section 1) is all that is needed. No separate migration file.

## 10. What's new in 5.0.0 — Shop Ledger (📒 লেনদেন খাতা)
Every shop now has a full transaction page. Open any shop (Owner / Manager / SO: **দোকান ও লোকেশন → shop**; DSR: **shop → detail**) and press **📒 লেনদেন খাতা**.

- **Top card:** current due, total given, total paid, number of memos.
- **চলমান মেমো (live memo):** starts with the first sale after the due was zero. It lists, in time order, every bill (date + time, slip, who delivered, total, cash paid, due added) and every later due collection (date + time, collector, which bill it paid) with the running due after each line.
- **Tap a bill** → every product with cases/pieces, price, line total, commission/discount, the bill's payable, and that bill's own due breakdown (total → cash at delivery → collected later → still due).
- **Due reaches zero → the memo closes automatically** (however many days it took) and moves to **📚 আগের মেমো**. The next sale opens a fresh memo. Tap any old memo to see its whole timeline.
- Damaged goods taken back (money/exchange) and point-sale returns appear as information lines and never change the due.
- The ledger's final due always equals the "মোট বাকি" shown everywhere else.

**Database:** run the full `schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL editor. The only changes in 5.0 are one new column (`due_calendar.tx_id`) and a few indexes (bottom of the file). Note: `schema.sql` drops and recreates tables, so it wipes existing data.
Older dues without `tx_id` are matched to their sale automatically (same shop + date + amount), so existing history appears in the ledger immediately.

Still 12 API files — the ledger lives inside `api/shops.js` (`action=ledger`, `action=ledger-sale`).
